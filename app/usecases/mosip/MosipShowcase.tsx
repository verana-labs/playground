            requesting Asha&apos;s ID is one she should trust. That gap is where fraud and over-collection live:

            Every card above used this exact query. Here you can drive it: pick a party and the page asks the
            live <strong>Verana Trust Resolver</strong> in your browser, including a self-signed issuer that
            should fail. A valid signature is authenticity; this is legitimacy.

            The participant tree is not just a diagram, it is enforced and economically backed. Accreditation can

            The same chain of trust you just built, end to end: the anchor defines the credential, accredits the
            issuer and verifier, the issuer hands Asha her Resident ID, and any verifier checks it all the way back
            to the root. Each <span className="text-emerald-600 font-medium">✓</span> is the resolver answering live.

              We followed Asha&apos;s credential from nothing: an anchor that&apos;s trusted, a schema everyone
              agrees on, an issuer that earned the right to issue, the credential itself, and a verifier she can
              trust back. Every box in the participant tree resolved green, live, on-chain. At each step the
